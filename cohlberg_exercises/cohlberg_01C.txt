# cohlberg_01C.txt, WESmith 04/01/23, these are FE1, FE2, FE3 examples

# It is necessary to cut/paste each section of interest into the jmol console
# to show the progression of the analysis. The commands 'pause', 'resume', 'prompt'
# don't seem to properly control the flow and show the intermediate analyses. Jmol
# appears to hijack the CPU with 'pause'. 

# 1) ----- FE1 SET UP for 1GZI: show cartoon; cut/paste to 2) -----------------------

# if showing hydrogens is desired, set pdbAddHydrogens before loading the object

#set pdbAddHydrogens;
load =1GZI;
show info;
show sequence;
show structure;
delete water;
cartoon only;
color structure;

# 2) ----- isolate the helices ------------------

restrict helix;

# 3) ----- isolate the sheets -----------------

select all; cartoon; restrict sheet;

# 4) ----- color residues 41-46 red to examine ------------

select all; cartoon; select 41-46; color red


# 1) ----- FE2 set up for 2KT2 ---------------

# if showing hydrogens is desired, set pdbAddHydrogens before loading the object

#set pdbAddHydrogens;
load =2KT2;
show info;
show sequence;
show structure;
delete water;
cartoon only;
color structure;

# 2) ----- isolate the sheets -----------------

select all; cartoon; restrict sheet;
