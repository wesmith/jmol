# It is necessary to cut/paste each section of interest into the jmol console
# to show the progression of the analysis. The commands 'pause', 'resume', 'prompt'
# don't seem to properly control the flow and show the intermediate analyses. Jmol
# appears to hijack the CPU with 'pause'.

# 1) ----- SET UP for 2LYZ lysozyme: show cartoon; cut/paste to 2) ---------------------

# if showing hydrogens is desired, set pdbAddHydrogens before loading the object

#    blue       = hydrogen-bonded turn (label T)
#    purple     = 3_10  helix (G): 3 residues per H bond: tighter
#    magenta    = alpha helix (H): 4 residues per H bond
#    darkviolet = pi    helix (I): 5 residues per H bond: looser
#    yellow     = extended strand in a beta sheet (E)
#    white      = not classified

# - a beta hairpin = two antiparallel beta strands connected by a small H-bonded turn
